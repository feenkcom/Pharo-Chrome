accessing
uniqueContextId
	"An alternative way to specify the execution context to evaluate in.
Compared to contextId that may be reused accross processes, this is guaranteed to be
system-unique, so it can be used to prevent accidental evaluation of the expression
in context different than intended (e.g. as a result of navigation accross process
boundaries).
This is mutually exclusive with `contextId`.
